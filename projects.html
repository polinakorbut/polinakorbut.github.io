            <h1>Basketball</h1>
            <p>
              Basketball has been the driving force behind my life since 5th grade, and I can't imagine living without it. From playing in Ukraine to becoming a member of the LCC Moose basketball team in Lithuania, I've always pursued my passion for the sport. </p>
			  <p>It's not just fun and social, but it also helps to develop strong teamwork skills, which are essential for success both on and off the court. </p>
			  <p>Whether I'm playing with friends or in a league, basketball always brings me joy and a sense of accomplishment.

            <h1>Reading</h1>
            <p>
              Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. I love immersing myself in a good book and getting lost in the world the author has created. </p>
			  <p>Fiction and fantasy are my go-to genres, as they transport me to other realms and allow me to escape reality for a while. There's something magical about getting lost in a story and feeling like you're a part of it. </p>
			  <p> One of my favorite authors is Tahereh Mafi. I have read many of her books, and she always does a great job with writing. The characters are dynamic, and the world-building is genuinely immersive. </p>
			  <p>Currently, I am reading her book This Woven Kingdom. I highly recommend this book for its exceptional writing style!

            <h1>Hiking</h1>
            <p>
              I enjoy hiking as a hobby, especially in the Ukrainian Carpathians. There's just something so refreshing about being out in nature and getting some exercise. </p>
<p>			  I particularly love going with my family, as it's always a special experience. And of course, the stunning scenery of the Carpathian Mountains never fails to take my breath away. </p>
<p> This summer, we hiked Petros Mountain and it was an amazing experience! The view from the top was breathtaking.
